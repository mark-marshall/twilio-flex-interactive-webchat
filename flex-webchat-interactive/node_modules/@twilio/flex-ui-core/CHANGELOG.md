## 0.33.0

### Added

-   Add `AudioPlayerManager` API for playing sounds. It supports playing and stopping sounds

Example:

Media to be played is defined as:

```
export interface MediaData {
    url: string;
    repeatable: boolean;
}
```

Note:

-   Repeatable medias are played in a loop, like a phone ringing that goes on and on. The only way to stop a repeatable media is to manually call the stop method.
-   Non-repeatable medias are played once, like a beep or bleep. Non-repeatable medias automatically stop after being played once.

To play media, make sure you specify the url and if it is repeatable or not

```
const mediaId = AudioPlayerManager.play(
    {
        url: "sound-url",
        repeatable: true
    },
    (error: AudioPlayerError) => {
        // handle error
    }
);
```

To stop media, use the media id returned from the `play` method:

```
AudioPlayerManager.stop(mediaId);
```

To mute or unmute sound, use the `toggleSound` method:

```
AudioPlayerManager.toggleSound(true); // to mute
AudioPlayerManager.toggleSound(false); // to unmute
```

### Fixed

-   Fix exception thrown when rendering table rows.

## 0.32.0

### Fixed

-   Fixed chat crashing when media message is received. `MessageBubble` now displays `MediaMessageError` string on such message.

## 0.31.0

### Added

-   Aria props properties to the following components to support accessibility:

    -   MessageInput:
        -   `sendButtonAriaProps` • AriaProps • Send button aria props (`{ ariaLabel: "Send Message" }` by default).
        -   `textAreaAriaProps` • AriaProps • Text area aria props (`{ ariaLabel: "Enter your message here to get help" }` by default).
    -   MessageList:
        -   `listContainerAriaProps` • AriaProps • List container aria props (`{ ariaLive: AriaLive.Off }` by default).

    Example on how to set aria attributes:

    ```
    Flex.MessageInput.defaultProps.sendButtonAriaProps = {
        ariaLabel: "Send Message",
        ariaLive: Flex.AriaLive.Polite
    };

    Flex.MessageInput.defaultProps.textAreaAriaProps = {
        ariaLabel: "Enter your message here to get help",
        ariaLive: Flex.AriaLive.Assertive
    };

    Flex.MessageList.defaultProps.listContainerAriaProps = {
        ariaLabel: "Message list",

    Chat: {
        MessageInput: {
            Button: {
                borderRadius: "5px",
                width: "100px",
                fontSize: "18px",
                svg: {
                    display: "none"
                },
                ":after": {
                    content: '"Send Button text"'
                }
            }
        }
    },
    <...>
```

## 0.30.2

### Changed

-   `CheckboxGroup` now supports custom options IDs

## 0.30.1

### Fixed

-   Components properly inherit font property of the `RootContainer`, thus allowing to change font consistently in whole application:

```
appConfig = {
    <...>
    colorTheme: {
        baseName: "FlexLight",
        overrides: {
            RootContainer: {
                "font-family": "Apple Chancery"
            }
        }
    }
```

## 0.30.0

### Added

-   `theme.FormComponents.Select` to Theme to customise the Select input item
-   New property `useSeparateInputStore` introduced in the payload for action `SetInputText`.
    Setting it to true, will store the message text in separate state and improves performance. From the next major release of Flex, this prop will be defaulted to true.
    This can be changed by setting the new default property `useSeparateInputStore` of `MessageInput`.

```
Flex.MessageInput.defaultProps.useSeparateInputStore = false;
```

-   `DynamiComponent` got a new property `rootContainerStyles` which is the set of CSS rules that are going to be applied by `DynamicComponent` to the main root container it is rendering. Default value of this is

```
    display: flex;
    position: relative;
    overflow-x: hidden;
```

### Changed

-   `TextareaItem` now uses MaterialUI's textarea to improve style consistency with `InputItem`.

-   `registerGlobalStyles` method is renamed to `registerStyles`. The `registerGlobalStyles` method is still available for backward compatibility.
-   CSS reset is no longer applied when `registerGlobalStyles` or `registerStyles` is called
-   New `resetCSS` method from `@twilio/frame-ui` package

### Fixed

-   MessagingCanvas loading issues before joining the channel.

## 0.25.0

### Added

-   Add `useLocalState` prop to `MessageInput`.
    This property, if set to true, will allow the developer to store the message input value in the component state instead of the Redux state.

**Please note:** `useLocalState` should be set to false if there's the intention of changing the input value using the "SetInputText" action.

## 0.21.0

### Changed

-   Fixed a issue where now we can set values for multiple fields in preengagement form.

### Added

-   `staticBackgroundBorderColor` property added to `theme.Progress.Circular` object.
    This property defines the color of the background border of the loading spinner, when not animating.
-   `animatingBackgroundBorderColor` property added to `theme.Progress.Circular` object.
    This property defines the color of the background border of the loading spinner, when animating.
-   `animatingForegroundBorderColor` property added to `theme.Progress.Circular` object.

## 0.20.0

### Added

-   `renderChildren` optional prop to `DynamicComponent`. Signature `(children: React.ReactNode[], align: string) => React.ReactNode[]`. This property is a callback that user
    of `DynamicComponent` can use if they want to alter the children of the fragments before rendering. By default DynamicComponent builds the list of children into its fragments from default children, children added via programmability and children added to the component tree via JSX. If `renderChildren` is specified then prior to any of the fragments rendered this callback is called to allow user the chance to change what the final rendered result will be. For example user may still want to filter out some of the children, wrap them all in some wrapper or maybe create brand new React components instead. `children` notes the children about to be rendered, `align` notes the name of the fragment rendered, which unless user has specified custom fragments, can be either `start` or `end`.

*   Support for promises to Actions framework.
    Now, if a before-action listener returns a Promise, the Actions framework will wait for it to be resolved before completing the action.
    This change is back-compatible, so a lister can still return return nothing.

```javascript
// Valid
Flex.Actions.addListener("beforeNavigateToView", (payload) => {
    payload.url = "test";
});

// Valid as well.
// NavigateToView action will wait for the returned promise to be resolved.
Flex.Actions.addListener(
    "beforeNavigateToView",
    (payload) =>
        new Promise((res) => {
            asyncCall(() => {
                payload.url = "myPromise";
                res();
            });
        })
);
```

-   Added character count indicator below text input when agent exceeds the limit.

### Changed

-   Moved reset CSS to top of head to allow any custom CSS to override it.
-   `SendMessage` action got optional `messageAttributes` property to its payload that, if specified, will be used as the equally named property of the Chat SDK `sendMessage` call.
-   Fixed UI issues with Chat input when shift+enter is pressed.
-   Fixed `selectItem` type in pre-engagement form by passing the missing value prop to `Select` and fixed the styles for the same.
-   Fixed the container width of `DynamicFrom` for webchat forms.
