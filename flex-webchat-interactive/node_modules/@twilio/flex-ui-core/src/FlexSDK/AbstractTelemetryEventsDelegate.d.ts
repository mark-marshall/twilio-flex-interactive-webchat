/**
 * Abstract class that outlines required methods for EventDelegates
 * to reimplement. Basic idea is that we might have different
 * event categories that will require various transformations
 * (based on category) before reporting. If we keep that logic
 * in FlexSDK file, it'll soon grow to the point it'll become unmaintainable.
 *
 * ## How to use this class
 *
 * Once you have a new event category to report, create a new class
 * that inherits from AbstractTelemetryEventsDelegate. Once inherited, implement
 * a few functions:
 * - `format` that converts an arbitrary object (X) to the event shape (T) declared by the delegate
 * - `getSchemeName` that returns an even scheme name to use
 * - `getEventGroupName` optional event group name for event aggregation
 * - `getEventName` that returns a name of the event that will be reported once `report` is called
 *
 * That way, if we ever need to create a new event category, it should
 * boil down to creation of the new class with two pre-defined methods
